# ILP-Genetic-and-Exhaustive-Solutions-to-the-ATM-Cash-Replenishment-Optimization-Problem
The ATM Cash Replenishment Optimization problem is a well known problem for the banking industry. Banks want to keep their ATMâ€™s loaded at all times, while minimizing the amount of idle cash that is in an ATM, since they can not make any interest money out of idle cash. However, loading itself also has a cost due to factors like transportation and security. This proposes an interesting game theoretic situation, where we have two conflicting costs that we want to optimize. We want to load an ATM as frequently as possible to minimize the interest loss while at the same time we want to load as seldom as possible to minimize the loading cost.

The code included under this repository was written by me and my boy @kadircanaksoy as part of the course CENG488: Guided Research offered by the Department of Computer Engineering, METU in Spring 2019. Our project was supervised by Prof. I. Hakki Toroslu.
